# FAIRMODE-Plots
An R-toolkit of functions for the evaluation of air quality models. The toolkit is able to create target diagrams and summary reports of analysis/assessment data and is inspired by the DELTA tool and the work of FAIRMODE in general. 

FAIRMODE-Plots has many similarities with the R-toolkit "dartle" which also features functionalities to create target diagrams and summary reports. "dartle" has not been updated in many years and has some serious limitations. These are some of the primary drivers behind the development of FAIRMODE-Plots. 

Currently, it is not possible to create target diagrams and summary reports for forecast data but this will be added in the near future. 

# Examples

Demo data with observed and modeled concentrations (from the DELTA tool) are available and examples are showcased here .
