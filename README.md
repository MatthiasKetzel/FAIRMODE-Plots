# FAIRMODE-Plots
An R-toolkit of functions for the evaluation of air quality models. The toolkit is able to create target diagrams and summary reports of analysis data and is inspired by the DELTA tool and the work of FAIRMODE. 

The same plots for forecast data will be added in the near future. Demo data with observed and modeled concentrations (from DELTA tool) are also available.
